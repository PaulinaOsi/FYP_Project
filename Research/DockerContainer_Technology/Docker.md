I decided to implement docker in my project as an experimental part of my project. the purpose of this was to still have the same functionality of my project but the difference would be that the functionality would now be in containers and would communicate seamlessly between one and one. for the communication between containers, I used docker-compose to do this as it creates a subnet that allows the containers to be created from images pulled grom docker hub and also custom images and allows for the communication between the containers.
Here in this section are the different sources that I used throughout my project to become more knowledgeable in the area for my FYP.
