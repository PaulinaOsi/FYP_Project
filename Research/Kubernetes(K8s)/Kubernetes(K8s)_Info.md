I decided to research Kubernetes to see what value it could add to my project as I find the topic of container technology rather interesting.  although while I'm still researching the topic I'm not 100 percent sure if I will integrate it in my project however I think I may opt for just using docker container technology to split the functionality of my project into containers rather than use Kubernetes to orchestrate the containers
