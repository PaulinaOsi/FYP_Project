### Tasks
 *For this week, I set out to accomplish the following tasks and so far I hope to accomplish the following tasks:*
 
- [ ] researching Alexa and home to implement it into the ESP32
- [ ] looking at build material for the house that I want to build for the demo   

<p></p>
<p></p>

### Update:
<p>For the virtual assistant I decided to go with the Alexa because of the in depth documentation that it has and also the possibility that it has to be able to integrate the Alexa with the esp32 to control various sensors . also this week I looked into the different  build materials that I could use to build my house because apart of my project is that I wanted to build a model to be able to demonstrate my functionality of my sensor and different technology that I wish t implement into my house </p>

#### Next Steps for this week :

<p>Update on the following things to do this week</p>

- [ ] researching Alexa and home to implement it into the ESP32
