ENGINEERING JOURNAL TEMPLATE

Date
-	every page MUST have a date
-	should always be a the top corner.

Tasks
-	list of tasks for the day
-	this serves as a way for you to collect your thought and set goals for the day/meeting

Reflection
-	should reflect what you have done for today
-	may include more if you happen to achieve a few more goals than listed in the “Tasks” section
-	should highlight interesting findings, especially those unexpected


Issues:

Hardware:
1.	outstanding issues on hardware development
2.	numbered entries.
3.	say “none” if absolutely no issue.
4.	content MUST be informative, and contain substance. Information like “chassis does not work” does not provide any useful information. Instead, information content will be something like: “Chassis lacks of bracing… too much friction on the axles so the chassis is sacking in the middle…”

Software:
-	outstanding issues on software development
-	numbered entries.
-	again, content MUST be informative… do not say things like “navigation is not working”.. that is not useful!

Solutions

Hardware:
-	if this is a solution which something happened today, it can be recorded in the reflection.
-	If this is to resolve an issue happened before today, you should refer it by the date followed by the number, e.g.
e.g. issue 1 recorded on June 1st.
solution : 6/1-1) solution is to …. etc.

Software:
-	Same as the hardware section.
