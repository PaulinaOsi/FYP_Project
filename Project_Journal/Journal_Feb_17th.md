### Tasks
- [ ] intergrating the Leds and the temp sensor with MQTT
- [ ] Starting the development of the webpage for my final year project using flex box 
- [x] Researching the Mean Stack 
- [ ] Researching the RSTP protocol for stream videos over the network 

<p>This week, i started to research  the Mean stack and i found that my findings on this topic wll enable me to take my project to the nexxt level</p>

### Issues and Solutions
 *For this week, this was the following issues I encountered:*

The fingerprint sensor from Grove ltd. needs 5v to power the sensor and the esp32 has both the 5v and 3.3v power rails and when I tried to connect the fingerprint sensor to the 5v power source it didn't power and I could find much documentation concerning fixing the power issue.
However, in my project, I am using the development board Raspberry Pi 4 and I saw on the web that there is much more documentation for integrating the fingerprint sensor with the pi 
So, in conclusion, I decided to begin the3 integration of the fingerprint sensor on the pi 4 and still have it communicate with the other sensor on the ESP32 via MQTT.

### Reflection
<p>I believe this week i was able o get a few things accomplished. I was able to check all of my sensors and test to see if they were in working order. I was able to spot on time that there was an issue with the fingerprint sensor for my home automation system and I am actively working on solving the issue. I was able to set MQTT communication on the raspberry pi and I am now working on getting it set up with the ESP 32 and also working towards setting up the fingerprint sensor on the raspberry pi </p>
<p></p>

#### Next Steps for this week :

- [ ] Contiuning my progress with the esp32

<p>During the lab class for project, I managed to set up the MQTT broker on the raspberry pi and I will now work on getting it integrated with the ESP 32.</p>

- [x] Solving the fingerprint sensor problem

<p>I think the next steps that I will take with the fingerprint sensor will be to try set it up on the raspberry pi and then test its functionality on that platform and finally have the fingerprint sensor on the pi communicate with the ESP 32 via MQTT</p>
