### Tasks
 *For this week, I set out to accomplish the following tasks and so far I hope to accomplish the following tasks:*
 
- [ ] Testing the sensors for my project 

### Tasks
<p>This week, I decided to commit most of my week to testing out the various sensors that i have in my project which are the following: </p>

- Gas Sensor 
- Temperature and Humidity sensor 
- proximity sensor
- piezo buzzer
- piCam (camera module for camera )
- finger print sensor

### Issues and Solutions
 *For this week, this was the following issues I encountered:*

#### Hardware:
| Name  | Issue  | Solution |
| :------------ |:---------------| :-----|
| Fingerprint Sensor    | while wiring up the sensor i noticed that when i wired up the sensor it would immediately switch off| Im going to try hook the sensor up to the specified voltage using a power supply or try another esp32 microntroller |
| Gas sensor   | When i wired up the sensor as per the datasheet everything seemed to be working order but the sensor doesn't seem to be picking up the presence of gas as it is just print "0" to the terminal which is the code for no gas present i the air| i'm going to try different smoke lighters and try wiring up the sensor again  |
| PiCam  | code issue via the terminal | $ERROR from terminal:mmal: Received unexpected camera control callback event, 0x4f525245, $pip uprade && rpi-update$ to update system and try the steps again |
