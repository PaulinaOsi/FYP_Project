### Update:
<p> this week i tried to set up the emulatior via android studio on my laptop but the software is extremely and it works better in the college computers and also it fails to run apps because it can't find an adb.exe file and states that the file is too old
so i tried to solve the problem by looking at solution on stack overflow but there wasn't any help solution and now the emulator just simply doesnt work and i dont have an android application to test on becausei dont own one 
so i think i will opt with the google assistant option feature for my FYP

- [ ] google assistant or flutter application
