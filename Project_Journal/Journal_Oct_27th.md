<p></p>
<p></p>

### Update:
<p> Last week I decided to go with the Alexa because of the in depth documentation that it has and I looked into the different  build materials that I could use to build my house because a part of my project is that I wanted to build a model to be able to demonstrate my functionality. But this week I wanted to focus my attention to Kubernetes because  it was a part of my proposal that I wanted to add to my project to see if it feasible to add this to my project </p>

#### Next Steps for this week :

<p>Update on the following things to do this week</p>

- [ ] Researching Kubernetes and docker
