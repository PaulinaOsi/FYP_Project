### Tasks
 *For this week, I set out to accomplish the following tasks and so far I hope to accomplish the following tasks:*
 
- [x] Testing the sensors for my project 
- [x] investigating why the fingerprint is not working 
- [x] Setting up MQTT between the Raspberry pi and the esp32

### Reflection and aspirations for next week:
<p>I believe this week i was able to get a few things accomplished. I was able to check all of my sensors and test to see if they were in working order. I was able to spot on time that there was an issue with the fingerprint sensor for my home automation system and I am actively working on solving the issue. I was able to set MQTT communication on the raspberry pi and I am now working on getting it set up with the ESP 32 and also working towards setting up the fingerprint sensor on the raspberry pi. My aspiration for next week are the following:
</p>

- [ ] intergrating the Leds and the temp sensor with MQTT
- [ ] Starting the development of the webpage for my final year project using flex box 
- [ ] Researching the Mean Stack 
- [ ] Researching the RSTP protocol for stream videos over the network
