A task that I had last week was finalising my project 
For my project ideas I had the following ideas:

- [ ] Language application
- [ ] A Home automation project 
- [ ] A Home automation project + virtual assistant of some sort 
- [ ] A drone delivery service co-ordination 

### Update:

I think that for my final year project I will opt for the home automation project because I find it more appealing to me and I feel that I can be more creative with this project  


#### Next Steps for this week :

<p>Update on the following things to do this week</p>

- [ ] To finalize my project idea and draft a plan on how I will go about doing my project
