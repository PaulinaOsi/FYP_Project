### Tasks
 *For this week, I set out to accomplish the following tasks and so far, I hope to accomplish the following tasks:*
 
- [x] Setting up my sensor and creating a Web Server on the ESP32  
- [ ] Setting up Alexa
 
<p></p>
<p></p>

### Update:
<p> currently I ran into issues implementing the alexa with the esp32. The implementation of the alexa with the es32 works with the 1st generation of the alexa and now the fauxmo library is deprecated. The issue with this is I have a 2nd gen alexa and the security for implementing the esp32  has since changed and become difficult to implement I will try to find a work around    </p>

#### Next Steps for this week :

<p>Update on the following things to do this week</p>

- [ ] Setting up my sensor and creating a Web Server on the ESP32  
- [ ] Setting up Alexa
