### Update:
<p> Last week I was researching the topic Kubernetes because it was a feature that I wanted to add into my project. During my  placement at intel I worked with this technology of orchestrating docker containers and I wanted  to see if I could implement similar into my final year project. And this week I will continue to research this topic to see if the possibility of adding it to one of my microcontrollers that Iâ€™m using in my project is possible </p>

#### Next Steps for this week :

<p>Update on the following things to do this week</p>
