Week of the 28 of October
Below I list the tasks that I assigned to myself to complete this week as part of my Final Year Project (FYP).
> I will develop the Kubernetes (K8s) cluster which will have one master and two nodes. My interactive website will be developed on the worker node. Further details of why developing websites and microservices on K8s have been explained in detail in my logbook.
> I will add push buttons to my LED code example of showing basic functionality in my Home automation system.
> I will research face cascade technology that is used in facial recognition and also research OpenCV that will be implemented on the IP camera that I have ordered.
> I will start designing my poster for my FYP.
